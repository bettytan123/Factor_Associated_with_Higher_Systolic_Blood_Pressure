# Factor_Associated_with_Higher_Systolic_Blood_Pressure

This is the Group C presentation for CHL 5222H Analysis of Correlated Data during my master at University of Toronto with Professor Aya Mitani. 
We prepared the nurse data by converting it from long to wide format to ensure compatibility with an R package for future analysis of correlations between different variables in the dataset using generalized estimating equation models and linear mixed-effects models.
We used various graphs, such as mean trajectories, to identify interesting patterns and better understand the differences between the control group and the treatment group.
